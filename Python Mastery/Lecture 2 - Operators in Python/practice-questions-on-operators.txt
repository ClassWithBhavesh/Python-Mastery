---> Membership Operator Questions (in, not in)
1. Write a program to check if the letter 'a' is present in the string "data analysis".

2. Check if the number 10 is present in the list:
li = [5, 8, 10, 12, 15]

3. Given a username input by the user, check if it exists in:
valid_users = ["admin", "user", "manager"]

4. Check if the color "blue" is not present in:
colors = ["red", "green", "yellow"]
If not present, print "Color not found".

5. Given email = "student@gmail.com", check if '@' exists in the email string.

6. Check if the fruit "Mango" is present in the tuple:
fruits = ("Apple", "Banana", "Orange")

7. Check if a key "price" exists in a dictionary:
product = {"name": "Laptop", "brand": "Dell"}

8. Write a program to check whether the number entered by a user is present in the list
numbers = list(range(1, 51))

9. Test whether the substring "Num" exists in "NumPy" (case sensitive).

10. Check if 'x' is NOT present in "python"
If true, print "Character missing".



---> Identity Operator Questions (is, is not)
1. Given:
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
Check if a is b.

2. Given:
x = [10, 20, 30]
y = [10, 20, 30]
Check whether x is y.

3. Given two variables:
a = None
b = None
Check if both are identical.

4. Check if:
A = True
B = 1
Are identical using is?

5. Given:
p = "hello"
q = p
Check identity using is.

6. Given two integers:
x = 256
y = 256
Check if both refer to the same object.

7. Given:
list1 = []
list2 = []
Check if they are not identical.

8. Check identity between:
a = 0
b = False

9. Write a program to verify if two dictionary objects point to the same memory reference.

10. Given:
num1 = int(1000)
num2 = int(1000)
Check: num1 is num2
Explain why identity differs here.



---> Bitwise Operator Questions (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
1. Given:
x = 6   # 110
y = 3   # 011
Use bitwise AND to determine if both have the same last bit.

2. Given a number, check if it is even using bitwise:
num & 1 == 0

3. Check if either of two feature flags is ON using bitwise OR:
flag1 = 0b010
flag2 = 0b100

4. Given:
a = 12   # 1100
b = 10   # 1010


Use XOR to detect differing bits.

5. Use bitwise NOT ~n to print the negative form of an integer.

6. Shift a number left by 1 bit and check if it becomes double:
value = 7

7. Shift a number right by 2 bits and check the result:
x = 40

8. Use:
num = 5
Check whether num << 3 equals num * 8.

9. Given:
x = 13   # 1101
Use bitwise operations to check if the second LSB is 1.

10. Given a binary permission system:
1 = Read
2 = Write
4 = Execute
Check if the user with permission 5 (101) has execute permission using bitwise AND.
